/**
 * PORT TO JAVASCRIPT (plain ES modules, no build step, run directly by the browser).
 *
 * PORT of `src/main.ts` from the TypeScript Solitaire PWA — the shell that owns the
 * screens, built on top of the ported Android app by Tobias Bielefeld (GPL-3.0).
 *
 * Differences from the PWA, all forced by living inside the Seclusa Games launcher:
 *
 *   - the game class is injected. The PWA hard-coded `new Klondike()`; this build hosts
 *     two games, so `games/klondike/index.html` passes Klondike and `games/pyramid/`
 *     passes Pyramid.
 *   - no service worker. The app-level `sw.js` owns caching for the whole umbrella app,
 *     and registering a second one from inside the frame would fight with it.
 *   - no CSS import. The host page links the stylesheets; there is no bundler to
 *     resolve `import './theme.css'`.
 *   - the asset base is a plain relative path instead of `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
 *
 * PRIVACY (kept from the Android app's README): no network requests, no analytics, no ads,
 * no tracking. Everything is stored in localStorage on the device.
